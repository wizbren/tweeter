# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This version of Tweeter was built by Brendan Brown, and will serve
as a running project that he'll continue to add to and improve on.
It ain't pretty, but it works (so far).


"End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death (project submission) is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it."
